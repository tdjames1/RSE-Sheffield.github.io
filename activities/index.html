<p>We would like to collaborate with you to help improve your research software in a range of areas. Supporting the entire University, we have collaborators in every faculty and have supported researchers in a range of subject areas including engineering, mathematics, computer science, biology, linguistics, physics, chemistry and geography.</p>
<p>Many of the things we do are <strong>free to you!</strong>. Email us at <a class="reference external" href="mailto:rse@sheffield.ac.uk">rse@sheffield.ac.uk</a> to see how we can help.</p>
<div class="section" id="faster-code">
<h2>Faster code</h2>
<p>We can work with you to optimise your code using a range of hardware and software technologies.
MATLAB, R, Python, Mathematica, C++, C, Fortran, CUDA and more - we have proven experience in helping researchers get results more quickly.
In some cases, we can provide significant speed-ups in just a few days for free.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="gpu-computing">
<h2>GPU computing</h2>
<p>We have specialists in GPU computing who can assist you with accelerating your computational problems using this relatively new technology. We can also help you learn more about deep learning, the powerful new machine learning technique that uses GPUs to solve complex data science problems.</p>
<p>As part of our <a class="reference external" href="http://gpucomputing.sites.sheffield.ac.uk/home">GPU computing at University of Sheffield</a> initiative, we are a NVIDIA GPU Research Centre which aims to teach how to use GPUs and help you gain access to hardware.</p>
<p>We also specialise in the use of agent based modeling on GPUs using FLAME or FLAME GPU to perform large scale simulations.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="high-performance-computing-hpc">
<h2>High Performance Computing (HPC)</h2>
<p>We collaborate with a range of partners including CiCS, N8, Archer and Microsoft to provide you with HPC support on local, regional, national and cloud-based facilities.</p>
<p>Locally, we assist CiCS in supporting users on their HPC clusters: Iceberg and ShARC. We are major contributors to their documentation system and can help you with software installation, training and advice on how to make maximum use out of these HPC resources that are free to all members of The University of Sheffield.</p>
<p>We work with the UK National Supercomputing service, Archer as <a class="reference external" href="http://www.archer.ac.uk/community/champions/">Archer Champions</a>. Our role is to advise users on the access of appropriate computational resources: and in supporting these users to access and exploit these resources appropriately.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="research-software-engineering">
<h2>Research Software Engineering</h2>
<p>We can help you take your computational workflow to the next level -- making it more automated, robust, open, accessible, user friendly and reproducible.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="increasing-research-impact-through-software">
<h2>Increasing research impact through software</h2>
<p>We believe that it is possible to increase the impact of your research by leveraging the research software you developed to make it possible. We can help you make your software open, citable and discoverable.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="grant-support">
<h2>Grant support</h2>
<p>We have a proven track record in working with PIs to obtain funding for dedicated Research Software Engineering posts and can offer assistance to you for your next grant application.</p>
<p>Working with organisations such as the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.software.ac.uk/">Software Sustainability Institute</a> and the UK community of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.rse.ac.uk/">Research Software Engineers</a>, we engage with funding providers to demonstrate the importance of research software engineers in modern research.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="supporting-lecturers">
<h2>Supporting lecturers</h2>
<p>We work with University of Sheffield lecturers to assist them in leveraging modern research software in their teaching.</p>
<p>A recent success story in this area is the work we did with Dr Marta Milo of the Department of Biomedical Science in the development of the <a class="reference external" href="http://opendsi.cc/bioinformatics/">BMS353 module</a>. Modern interactive, cloud-based, open-source technologies were combined with innovative teaching methodologies to develop a highly successful course.</p>
<p>We give talks and seminars on the use of research software in teaching - an example of which is the talk on <a class="reference external" href="http://mikecroucher.github.io/ChemEng_Jupyter_talk2016/">Project Jupyter and SageMathCloud</a> at the 2016 Chemical Engineering teaching away-day.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="support-of-site-licensed-rse-software">
<h2>Support of site licensed RSE software</h2>
<p>The University of Sheffield's IT department, CiCS, invests heavily in the provision of best-in-class commercial software applications for the benefit of the University's students and researchers. We work with CiCS and software vendors such as Mathworks, Microsoft, Wolfram Research, Intel, NVIDIA, Maplesoft and NAG to provide training and support to members of the University to help maximise the impact of these investments.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="training-outreach-and-education">
<h2>Training, outreach and education</h2>
<p>The group is involved in a range of training and outreach activities including Code Cafe, Software Carpentry and a full module in <a class="reference external" href="http://www.dcs.shef.ac.uk/intranet/teaching/public/modules/level4/com4521.html">Parallel computing with GPUs</a>.</p>
